   * @brief last_command returns the command which was pushed most recently to the undo stack.
   * @note caution! if the command is still on the stack, modifying it may cause bad things.
   *   There is a good reason Qt decided to return only const-pointers to commands on the command
   *   stack. (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qundostack.html#command).
   *   There are good reasons not to follow this policy here, too. Just be careful.
   *   If the command is not on the stack, it has probably been deleted. The caller is responsible
   *   for ensuring not to access a deleted object.
   * @note this function is merge-proof. if the last command was auto-deleted because its contents
   *   were merged with the previous one, the previous command will be returned.
   * @note undefined behaviour if index is not at top of the stack. index will be at top if a
   *   command was recently pushed and no undo/redo has occured since.
