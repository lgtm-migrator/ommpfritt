*ommpfritt* or short *omm* is a free and open source vector modelling and
motion graphics application.
It brings the workflow of (3D) modelling tools to the 2D vector graphics world.
The design of the application encourages and supports the user to produce
maintainable documents,
using concepts like procedural modelling and non-destructive editing.

Conceptually *omm* is a mix of traditional vector graphic editors
(e.g., *inkscape*), CAD applications and (3D) modelling tools.
Primary use case is creating, editing and rendering all sorts of animated and
still graphics, diagrams, icons and drawings.

## How to Get It

*omm* is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).
You can get its source from [github](https://github.com/pasbi/ommpfritt) and
build it.
You may find [build instructions](doc/build.md) helpful.

For any **LINUX**, there is an [AppImage](https://github.com/pasbi/ommpfritt/releases),
which requires no installation, make the [downloaded file executable and just run it](https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html#ref-quickstart).
For **WINDOWS**, [there is an installer](https://github.com/pasbi/ommpfritt/releases).

You can install [ommpfritt-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ommpfritt-git) from the AUR if you prefer a native package on Arch Linux.

*omm* has been tested on various Linux Distributions and Windows.
It has never been tested on **Mac**. It works in theory.


## How to use

*omm* was designed to be very easy to use.
So if you can handle a mouse and a keyboard, it should be no problem to get
started without studying the manual.

Maybe you find the [feature list](doc/features.md) helpful.

There is a (quite outdated)
[screen cast on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X5Lo7kq5eM)
that shows some of the most important features and how they can be used.
